# Dictozy: Voice Dictation

Dictozy is a Chrome extension for dictating short text into supported web fields. Focus a field, click the visible microphone button, speak, and Dictozy inserts the returned transcript where you were writing.

The project includes both the Chrome Manifest V3 extension and the FastAPI backend that performs speech-to-text through xAI. The extension never calls xAI directly and never contains the xAI API key.

## Landing Page

A static product landing page is available at [site/index.html](site/index.html). It is safe to open directly in a browser and uses the checked-in Chrome Web Store screenshots and icon.

## Architecture

The browser extension interacts with supported page fields, records short audio clips after explicit user action, and sends audio to the FastAPI backend. The backend calls xAI Speech-to-Text and returns a transcript for insertion into the active field.

The extension must never call xAI directly. API keys belong only on the backend.

## MVP Stack

- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Plain JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Python FastAPI
- xAI Speech-to-Text API

## Current Status

Version `0.1.2` is prepared locally:

- Chrome extension detects supported fields and ignores unsafe fields.
- Microphone button records only after explicit user click.
- Popup includes an enabled/disabled toggle for Dictozy.
- Extension sends audio to the configured FastAPI backend.
- Backend calls xAI Speech-to-Text.
- Transcript is inserted back into the focused field.
- xAI API key stays backend-only in `.env`.
- Backend tests and a local manual QA page are available.
- Backend Docker deployment files are available.
- Production endpoint validation and deployment smoke tests are available.
- Chrome Web Store copy, screenshots, promo tile, icon, and release checklist are prepared under `store/`.

## Local Development

The extension records a short user-triggered clip, sends it to the configured FastAPI backend, and inserts the transcript returned by the backend. The backend calls xAI Speech-to-Text using `XAI_API_KEY` from environment variables.

## Quick Start

Clone and enter the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredjkhar/voice-dictation-extension.git
cd voice-dictation-extension
```

Backend setup:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `XAI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`, then run:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Extension setup:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Click Load unpacked.
4. Select the `extension/` folder.
5. Reload any test page after loading or reloading the extension.
6. Open the extension popup to enable/disable Dictozy, adjust the recording limit, or open Advanced backend settings if needed.

QA page:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/qa/manual-test-page.html
```

## Verification

Run backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

Run extension syntax checks from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool extension/manifest.json >/dev/null
node --check extension/content.js
node --check extension/dom-utils.js
node --check extension/background.js
node --check extension/popup.js
node --check extension/config.js
node --test extension/tests/*.test.js
```

Validate and create the Chrome Web Store draft ZIP:

```bash
python3 scripts/package_extension.py
```

Validate the Chrome Web Store visual assets:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_store_assets.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- `502 Bad Gateway`: FastAPI reached xAI but xAI failed or rejected the request. Check backend logs for `xAI STT` warning lines.
- `403` from xAI: the xAI team may need credits or Speech-to-Text access.
- `503`: `XAI_API_KEY` is missing or not loaded by the backend.
- Extension stuck on `Transcribing`: reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`, refresh the page, and retry with a short recording.
- Microphone button does not appear: reload the page after loading the extension and focus a supported non-sensitive field.
- Backend URL does not work: use the production Render endpoint or local HTTP on `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. Other remote hosts and xAI URLs are rejected.

## Deployment

The backend includes Docker deployment files under `backend/`. See [backend/DEPLOYMENT.md](backend/DEPLOYMENT.md).

After deploying the backend, set the extension popup Backend URL to the deployed HTTPS `/api/transcribe` endpoint.

Use the popup's Advanced Check Backend control to verify `/health`, then follow [qa/deployment-smoke-test.md](qa/deployment-smoke-test.md) for a complete production-path check. The backend also includes a reusable command-line smoke test:

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/smoke_test.py https://YOUR_BACKEND_HOST
```

## Chrome Web Store Readiness

Privacy and release-preparation materials are available in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md), [store/](store/), and [site/](site/). The generated ZIP under `dist/` is intentionally ignored by Git and should be rebuilt from the reviewed source before each draft upload.

## Commit Readiness

Before committing:

- Confirm `backend/.env` is not in `git status`.
- Confirm `backend/.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, and `.pytest_cache/` are not in `git status`.
- Run the verification commands above.
- Do not commit real API keys, raw audio, or generated local caches.

## GitHub Project Hygiene

Issue templates are available for:

- Bug reports
- Hardening tasks
- Future feature requests

Use hardening tasks for reliability, privacy, documentation, and QA work. Use feature requests for product scope changes.
